# exif_secure

All of the photos you share online have a ton of meta data associated with them. Frequently, this data includes: the location the photo was taken, the time it was taken, and detailed information about your camera / phone device.  Facebook may want this information, but not to help you out.  There is usually no reason that *you* would want to share any of this information with anyone.

Enter the `exif_secure` tool.

This is a very short Python script that I use to strip all of the metadata from my photos before I share them with people.  It is lightweight, easy-to-use, and fast.  If you are like me, you take a lot of photos, and this tool will help protect your privacy.
